# HydroVision Model 6.O

A 'HydroVision Model 6.O' is a project aimed at classifying water quality through advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging multiple algorithms, the model evaluates essential water parameters to provide accurate and actionable classifications, enabling better monitoring and resource management.

More Info:

• How does it work? The project integrates six machine learning algorithms to classify water quality based on key parameters. Using data-driven insights, it processes features such as pH levels, turbidity, and chemical properties to predict water quality classes effectively.

• Resources: (1.) Python programming language; (2.) Libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data analysis; (3.) Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for visualization; (4.) Advanced algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost for classification; (5.) ROC curves and cross-validation techniques for performance evaluation.

• Showcased at (off-site): This project is part of a 4-week internship presented by Edunet Foundation, in collaboration with AICTE and Shell, focusing on green skills using AI technologies.
